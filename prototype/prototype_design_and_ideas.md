# fermentation-computer
Fermentation computer prototype based off of Arielle's proof of concept

## Prototype Ideas
- Minimize the mechanical tasks to validate electronics and understand routing better
- Prioritize performance over aesthetics but aim to make it not look like garbage.
- Prioritize performance over fabrication effort (both hw & sw) over cost.
- Minimize the foot print of components inside the chamber. Avoid putting anything permenent on the outside of the bin and avoid putting anything on the inside of the bin. Most components should reside on the top. This will maximize fermentation volume and improve cleanability.
- Assume fermentation will typically happen in warm and humid environments.
- Test a heating mat on the outside of the unit. Implies there will be an insulation skin / bag
- Can probably burn the insulation skin / bag at the edges, then turn bag inside out, then attach heating pad to the skin. 
- If there is an obvious way to attach the humidifier to the skin, do that. Otherwise, it is okay to break the "nothing attached to the bin" objective
- This device will run headless. The electronics will be covered by a removable reflectix top. Velcro might not stick very well to it. Test buttons.
- This food computer will look like a big silver blob. Probably will need some thought on how to make it look good. On plus side will likely look very spacey.
- Threw in some leds to the BOM. That might make it either look pretty cool. Or very not so. Will need to test.

## Prototype v2 Ideas
- Clean up the electronics mounting either by creating a custom PCB that is optimal for brain box and functional for fermentation computer or mount all the circuit boards with standoffs to top of lid. Consider having an acrylic "interface plate"
- Add more features as desired. Obvious ones include cooling and co2 dosing. I wonder if we could just water cool around the container. Similar to the heating. The water chiller will likely be "tumored" onto the back of the machine like the humidifier and co2 tank.
-a heated and cooled water jacket would be very slick and is what they use for high-end wine fermenters
